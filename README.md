# wxpython
#This is a simple code to make a single frame of windows using wxpython. I am curently using jupyter notebook and anaconda navigator for #the development of these frames.
#Further I would like to add a simple example of an algorithms which i will be using in the application as well.
#I m using python only and libraries like mathplot.lib , sklearn , keras , numpy etc etc.
########### MY MAIN GOAL IS TO MAKE A WINDOWS BASED CANCER DETECTION APPLICATION WHICH CAN BE USED BY THE DOCTORS AS A REFERANCE TO LOOK AT #####
#The application will be simple to use nad interactive , containibg two frames . 1) The frame that will enter the data by the user. When #the user will click on submitt button , the algo will start and will give its predictions on the case . And will show a graphical #representation of the answer. The user can either log in or can use it as a guest . The history will be maintained in the login mode.
